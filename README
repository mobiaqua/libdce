= About Distributed Codec Engine - RPMSG =

DCE is a library to remotely invoke the hw accellerated codecs on IVA-HD via a syslink/rcm shim layer.
This provides access to the [http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:Codec_Engine Codec Engine]
codec interface on the coprocessor (ducati/M3) from the host.

It is similar in purpose to remote codec engine, although at the time RCE was not supported on OMAP4430,
and DCE was a simple way to get the same result.
They should be roughly interchangeable from the user's perspective.
